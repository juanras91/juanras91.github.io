							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>
						<p>August, 2020</p>
						<p>I was born in La Paz Bolivia, coming from a family where I was always taught to do my best in order to contribute for a better society and a better world. I found my passion in engineering by following my father's footsteps and then I decided to obtain my bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering in my native city. I was also able to discover a little bit more about the world when I did an international volunteering service in the United Kingdom. I got to improve my language skills and I found that I love communicating in different languages. This is why i decided to learn a third language and study abroad. During my professional life I contributed on the development and construction of automated machines for the industry. At the same time I was developing connected objects and sensors for the industry or just for my home, mostly as a maker. This is where I knew I wanted to build a careerpath developing connected embedded systems. Later on, I was able to pursue my dream of achieving a master's degree in wireless embedded systems, in France.</p>

								<h3>HMI application</h3>
								<p>Development of a HMI test application case on a raspberry pi 4 and a 5 inch touchscreen. This application was developed for the puropose of training myself on the QT framework for embedded devices. For this application case, I used Yocto to create a development image with all the required metadata to run Qt5. I created a simple GUI image, with the possibility of running multiple back-end processes.

								<h3>NFC and Lora communication</h3>
								<p>Integration of the NFC and Lora communication protocols on an Generic Expert Platform for Wireless Embedded Applications. The electronic developement board is an SoC based on a system on module and a motherboard. From the NFC perspective, the purpose of the project was to communicate and manage the board by using an Smartphone application and the NFC protocol to exchange data between the board and the smartphone. Device driver development for embedded NFC chip. Development f the user-space application to communicate with the smartphone application. Development of an Android application for data exchange. Integration of an external Lora module and a user-space application to communicate with a LoRa Gateway.</p>

								<h3>Humidity and Temperature IoT controller</h3>
								<p>Development and implementation of a temperature and humidity controller and an Android application for a laboratory. The purpose of the project was to be able to control the temperature and the humidity from an smartphone application. Development of an embedded application to collect the temperature and humidity of different environments, and based on the information we can send information the actuator's controller. The embedded OS was based on a debian distribution and the applications were added as debian packages. The temperature and humidity can be set through the smartphone Android application.</p>
